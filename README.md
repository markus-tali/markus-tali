Hey

üñ•Ô∏è Studying @ kood/J√µhvi
If code doesn't work, don't worry, it works on my computer :)

Some of the things i've learned with these projects:
- Golang
- JavaScript
- React
- Docker
- SQLite
- Shell/bash
- Git
- Once you get lost in git hell, just read error message. If that doesn't work, burn it.
